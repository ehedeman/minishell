TO DO
[x] << EOF :ctrl+c not exiting
	---> it's exiting only if anything is pressed after ctrl+c
[x] "   " leaks
[x] '   ' leaks
[x] 'cat | cat | ls' should behave in a "normal way"
	---> it should run ls return the prompt without having to press ctrl+c (bash returns after 2x enter)
	---> it is runnig ls and returning prompt only after ctrl+c
[x] echo -n hello > file :not printing to file
[x] echo -n hello >> file :same
[x] echo hello > file how are you :printing 'how are you hello' to file, instead of 'hello how are you'
[x] echo -n hello > file | cat -e
[x] echo -n hello | cat -e | wc -c
[] go through eval sheet again
[] main.c and minishell.h-> delete stuff for debugging in the end, rest of norm should be ok.
[] check norm one last time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IN PROGRESS
[smatschu]
	[x] go through eval sheet

[ehedeman]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TESTS (test with existent and non existent files)

Generally

Redirection
[OK] ls > file1
[OK] <file1 cat
[OK] <file ls
[OK] >file ls -la
[OK] ls >file1.txt -l
[OK] cat <file1 >file2
[OK] cat <<EOF >file
[OK] echo a '>>'file>file2
[OK] echo hello ">" file

Pipes
[OK] echo $:$= | cat -e ------> supposed to be "$:$=$"
[OK] echo " $ " | cat -e ---------> supposed to be " $ $" (bash prints also the spaces)
[OK] echo ' $ ' | cat -e ---------> " $ $"
[OK] echo $? | echo $? | echo $? ---------->prints a newline too much
[OK] echo hello | cat -e
[OK] echo hello | wc -w | cat -e
[OK] ls -la | grep ".c" | wc -l
[OK] echo hello "|" cat -e
[OK] env | wc
 

Redirection with pipes
[OK] echo hello > file | wc -w
[] ls -la > file1 | ls -la > file2 :file 2 is being created, but not before ls -la, so it is not on the list, should show on the list in file1 and file2
[] > file1 ls -la | > file2 ls -la :file2 is being created and is shown only in file2. should also show in file1.
[OK] < info.txt cat | wc -c > file2 :is creating file1 after ctrl+c and not wc, or at ctrl+d, but not wc properly
[OKish] echo a >file | cat <file 			------> works but cat <file is not supposed to print stuff, aka its a nice cool feature of minishell
[OKish] ls -la>file>file1>file2 | cat <file2 ------> works but cat file2 is not supposed to print ls -la aka its a nice cool feature of minishell
[OKish] >file>file1>file2 ls -l | cat <file2 ------> works but cat file2 is not supposed to print ls -la aka its a nice cool feature of minishell
[OKish] ls > | wc ...works like in bash but...
	bash: syntax error near unexpected token `|'
	minishell: syntax error near unexpected token '>'
[let's just not go there] ls>|wc should create a wc file and print the ls output on it
[OK] >>file echo hello | cat < info.txt (it creates the file and runs the cat on info.txt, but hello got lost)
[OK] >>file echo '$USER' | cat <file (if file existed before, just cat whatever was there before, but it its not overwritten with $USER)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE
[x]tab is running ls: if you press Tab twice without typing anything or 
just after typing a part of a filename or directory name, 
readline will list all files and directories in the current directory.
[x]p is running pwd, c cd, e echo and so on.
[x]echo $PATH${NAME}$WTVR
[x]expr $? + $?
[x] export FOO=test, than export FOO, should not update FOO.
[x]SHLVL
[x]history command (capacity is set to 5 for easy visualization, can change to 2000 later like bash)
[x] export FOO=test, than export FOO, should not update FOO.
[x]ctrl-C in a prompt after you wrote some stuff should show a new line with a new prompt
	and command + CTRL+c + ENTER should not execute command (handler?)
[x]if you run ctrl+c and no enter, ctrl+d doesnt work
[x]cat < file leaks ------------ no it doesnt -----------
[x]from some eval sheet: "ctrl-\ in a prompt after you wrote some stuff should quit minishell?" Seems to be working like in bash, so wtvr.
[x] norm arg_expansion
[x]on bash: export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups , so history in bash ignores consecutive dup cmds
[x] what is this exactly?
	mode = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH;
-> mode is the right that the file gets when created (RUSR = Read User etc.)
[x] whats this flag -fno-omit-frame-pointer for?
->debug flag for fsanatize, used last in so_long. think u can get more info on the leaks etc with that flag
but not sure
[x]exit function can take one value as argument
	run bash
	exit 123
	echo $? will return 123
	on minishell, exit 123
	on bash, echo $? should display 123
[x]input check for pipe without content
[x]basic and multiple pipes
[x]echo $?"$?"$? is working, but echo $? "$?" $? not, also asd "asd" asd not
[x]arg expansion needs to recognize '$ within words when lowercase, uppercase no?
	seems like it's a bash version thing? or check again in school.
	my version: GNU bash, version 5.1.16(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
[x] $USERblabal should not print anything, but...
[x] "$USER"blabla should expand user, but I can't expand USER if i dont have the "" anymore.
[x] echo "hello" '|' cat -e should print hello | cat -e -> operstors with siongle quotes in general
[x]echo '$USER'$? is saving '$USER'$? as a whole arg. Fix parsing or should rewrite echo again?
[x]input redirection without executing the command immideadly -> redirect input then run the command loop, reset input at end
[x] wc -l > info.txt < hello ;  should redirect the output of wc -l > info.txt to hello (operators might be the other way around)
[x] << end ; input redirecion until but without command (leaks)
[x] "echo hello |" now asks to complete input
[x]replace_env_vars has invalid read size (try make leaks (from MAKEFILE), then type any command it'll show the exact line)
[x] aren't exec_com_fork and exec_file_fork the same? (execute_file_utils.c)
->nope, one is for files only (eg. ./a.out) the other is strictly for commands (difference
is the part where the "./" gets strjoined to the rest, but because of norm  and for simplicity
i made it into two)
[x]norm arg_expansion
[x] pipes with redirection (basic and multiple pipes work)
[x] commands called through execve make the programm loop if failed (eg when the "file not found" message pops up)
[x] running ./minishell , bash and than ./minishell again is stucked in the .output
[x] cd -> /bin/cat: .output_the_first_cuz_what_the_fuck: No such file or directory
[x] idk where TEST-1 is comming from, but sth definately made the exit_status not be updated correctly anymore in case of file or command not found.
[x] cat
[x] .output file is not being deleted in the end
[x] rm .output -> /bin/cat: .output: No such file or directory
[x] commands starting with < or > after running sth, if doing its thing and printing whatever is still stored in .output
	for example:
	1. echo hello
	2. <nonexistentfile ls
	will print
	nonexistentfile: before and is still store in .output
	hello
[x] add other shell names to the "list"
[x] ./minishell, ./minishell, exit prints /bin/cat error message
[x] 42header emails @student.42wolfsburg.de
[x]echo $? should print exit value
	[x] bash commands
	[x] ./whatever
	[x] exit 123 or any number higher than 255 (you can enter bash or ./minishell and exit, than echo $? to see if it gets the right value)
	[x] command or file than does not exist (127)
	[x] file without permission (126)
	[x] syntax errors, missing keywords or commands -> exit_status 2
		[x] for example: exit asdasd -> exit_status 2 (exit 234 asd -> 1)
		[unnecessary] others, in parsing maybe? -> have to change main_error and wherever it is being called to take mini and use mini->exit_status
	[not doable without global] script terminated by ctrl+c -> exit_status 130
	[x] ctrl D exit with 0, not 1
[x] check operator and lack of spaces in general
[not requested on subject, so no]history: with one value as argument to change ammount of lines from history to print
[not requested on subject, so no]history: -c to clear the history
[bonus only, no need]
	echo "'$USER'" should print 'USER_VALUE'
	echo '"$USER"' should print "$USER"
[x] norm
[x] when executing shell commands, should take the path from the struct linked list, and not hardcode the path,
	so that if we unset $PATH, the commands like ls, wc, don't work anymore. -->added a condition to add /bin/ only if it is in the path
[x] if exit and PATH not in env, rm gives error --> fixed by changing main_remove_output_file.c
