how parsing works step-by-step:

1. pasing() returns a linklist (similar to the one in libft)

it takes the input, cllocates a node (consisting of an argument list argv, the number of arguments argc,
the operator for those arguments saved and the next node in line)

so a list would perhabs look like this:

Node 1:

argv[0] = pwd
argc = 1
operator = PIPE
next = (pointer to) Node 2

Node 2:

argv[0] = cat
argv[1] = -e
argc = 2
operator = NONE
next = NULL

there might be errors (lots of them probably) but the basic idea works.

things to know:

-quotation marks will be removed before putting it into the list
-operator signs (<>|) can be typed both "pwd>out" and "pwd > out".
-operator signs will not get listed in argv (they get skipped and instead
the operator value is set)


-currently working on checking the input for invalid stuff (such as single quotation marks because the parser 
cannot and is not supposed to handle that)

-parsing is very much not norminette conforming but i dont think its smart to clean everything up
before making sure everything works properly.

cd is also working and tailored to the parsing method. if you type cd then it gets you to home/user.
if you type cd Directory (without the /), then it gets itself the path youre currently on and adds the new
Directory. Then it heads there (worked when i tried it).
if you type cd /whatever_path, then it just gets you there. pwd works somewhat but i havent changed it to work with
redirection and such, since redirections etc arent really implemented yet. (it works to test cd but thats it.)
