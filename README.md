# Minishell

or minihell, as we like to call it.
This is a project from 42Wob, done in teamwork with 42WoBsmatschu, where we were supposed to programm a shell with bash as example of how the shell is supposed to behave.

The project is compilable through the makefile, subject is included in the repo.
